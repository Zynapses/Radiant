---

## Purpose

Use challenging edge-case scenarios to stress-test the implementation.

---

## Load Document

Read: `docs/prompts/RADIANT-PROMPT-33-Update-v3-INTERROGATION.md`

## Testing Process

For each of the 55 scenarios:

1. Read the scenario carefully
2. Explain how the implementation handles it
3. Show the relevant code
4. Identify any gaps

## Scoring

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ✅ PASS | Code shown, handles correctly |
| ⚠️ PARTIAL | Concept understood, code incomplete |
| ❌ FAIL | Not implemented or incorrect |

## Pass Threshold

- Must pass 50/55 scenarios (91%)
- Each section needs 4/5 to pass

## When Complete

Report final score, then say:

"Phase 33 complete. INTERROGATION TESTING COMPLETE."
"Final Score: XX/55 (XX%)"
"RADIANT v4.18.0 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE."
